# Preparation
*If you already have PostgreSQL in `PATH`, you're ready*.

Otherwise: 
- Download PostgreSQL binaries (zip archive) from [**here**](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/). *Tested version is 15.3*.
- Extract the `pgsql` directory of the archive into this directory (so that the binary is at `pgsql/`).
